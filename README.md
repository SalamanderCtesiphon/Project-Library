# Project-Library
The library project for The Odin Project's intermediate JavaScript course.
Vanilla CSS and HTML with JavaScript for functionality.
This project utilizes most of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript techniques that I have learned so far.
It uses object oriented programming principals as well as prototypal inheritence.
